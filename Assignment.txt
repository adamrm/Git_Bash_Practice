1. Research up what a compiler does from start to finish, with an emphasis on  dynamic vs static linking.
2. Write a shell script to do the following.



The directory structure is as follows
	
	/Dir/ 
		file1 -> /x/y/file1
		file2 -> /z/q/file2
		file3- > /x/y/file3
		file4 -> /x/y/file4
		file5 -> /o/q/file5
  etc. 

Find all symlinks that point to a file in /x/y and move the file to /z/q, and update the symlink in /Dir to reflect the new location.
